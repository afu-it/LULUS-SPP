Error: Turbopack build failed with 1 errors:
./src/app/api/search/route.ts:2:1
Export prisma doesn't exist in target module
  1 | import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
> 2 | import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  4 | export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  5 |   const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams;

The export prisma was not found in module [project]/src/lib/prisma.ts [app-route] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import getPrisma?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
